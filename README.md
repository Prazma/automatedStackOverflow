# Automated StackOverflow
### What is this?
I have created a new algorithm, of which allows a computer to generate a custom responce to a natural language (like English, Spanish, Japanese and etc). So, by using a combination of that algorithm with a little knowledge of programming programmed into the chatbot, I have created a **bot that answers to questions that you see on StackOverflow.**

The programming langauges currently supported are:
* JavaScript
